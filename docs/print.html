<p><a href="https://www.templeos.org/">TempleOS</a> is a biblically inspired lightweight operating system (OS) that represents the prophesied Third Temple. It was developed by American programmer Terry A. Davis, who suffered from schizophrenia while working on it. Throughout his development of TempleOS he experienced maniac episodes; stating to have been visited by aliens and being under the surveillance of Government Agencies.</p>
<p>Regardless of your opinions on the creator or the goal of TempleOS, we can all agree that it is a masterpiece. Unlike most (dare I say &quot;all&quot;) operating systems, TempleOS and its components were solely created by one person; from the compiler, kernel, and all the programs within it, to even the software it was built in. Terry Davis truly is the smartest programmer to ever live, and will always be.

This site will hopefully unravel the beauty of TempleOS, so if you're a person who'd like to learn TempleOS, or even a person who is skeptical about the practicality of TempleOS; then this site is for you. It is worth mentioning that all information on the site assumes you have a fundamental understanding of Operating Systems, computing components, and optionally programming.<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="installing-templeos"><a class="header" href="#installing-templeos">Installing TempleOS</a></h1>
<p>So the time has come; you want to purify your system? Well, unfortunately, it's not that easy. Running TempleOS on bare metal is somewhat of a challenge as TempleOS was only made for select hardware. Fortunately, running TempleOS is possible under a Virtual Machine.</p>
<h2 id="running-templeos-on-a-vm"><a class="header" href="#running-templeos-on-a-vm">Running TempleOS on a VM</a></h2>
<p>To start, you'll need to establish which virtual machine you'll be using, generally, there are three options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vmware.com/au/products/workstation-player.html">VMware Workstation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VirtualBox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All essentially do the same job of virtualizing an OS, however, there is a major difference when it comes specifically TempleOS, that is that VirtualBox does not support PC speakers; it might not be that big of an issue however it is more immersive when you can use your speakers, in which case you should be using VMWare Workstation (or even QEMU). I personally recommend QEMU however based on its simplicity.</p>
<p>This guide will require you to have a basic understanding of how to create a virtual machine using your desired VM software, as the process is universally the same.</p>
<p>You can download TempleOS from <a href="https://www.templeos.org/Downloads/TempleOS.ISO">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="using-virtualbox--vmware-workstation"><a class="header" href="#using-virtualbox--vmware-workstation">Using VirtualBox / VMWare Workstation</a></h3>
<p>This will be detailed specifically for VirtualBox since I don't run VMWare, however, you should be able to replicate this using VMWare; as long as you have half a brain cell, and two functional arms.</p>
<p>Upon opening, VirtualBox selects the &quot;New&quot; button.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Enter a name for your Virtual Machine, you can name it anything. For Type select &quot;Other&quot; and the version, select &quot;Other/Unknown (64-bit)&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, you'll be required to enter the amount memory to use; generally TempleOS only needs 512MB to boot, however, be safe and give it around 2 to 4 Gigabytes of RAM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After memory, you'll be prompted for a hard disk, select &quot;Create a virtual hard disk now&quot;. On the next screen select &quot;VDI&quot;, next &quot;Dynamically allocated&quot;. Finally for the HD size, just enter in 2GBs and create.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should now be able to launch, open doing so select the TempleOS ISO that you downloaded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the left panel, you should be prompted to install TempleOS, all you'll need to do is press <code>y</code> 3 times (Easier than installing Linux). At this point, you're all good to go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the live CD by selecting the Virtual Machine, going to &quot;Settings&quot;, &quot;Storage&quot; and removing the ISO. This will allow you to boot into the fresh install.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I've seen orangutans cut a tree in half, so if you can't do this, I'm honestly ashamed.</p>
<h3 id="using-qemu"><a class="header" href="#using-qemu">Using QEMU</a></h3>
<p>I usually recommend using QEMU as it's completely free and cross-platform. Additionally, QEMU supports audio output for TempleOS. Note that this guide for using QEMU is intended for Linux specifically.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Once you have the ISO saved somewhere on your disk, we can create a Virtual Disk Image:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">qemu-img create -f qcow2 temple 2G
</code></pre>
<p>qemu-img is the program for managing disks, create will create a disk, -f is a file flag and we chose a qcow2 file, temple will be the name of the file, and 2G means 2 gigabytes in size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up the host audio. This tells QEMU how your host projects the audio. Use this command if your Linux host uses pulse audio:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">export QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=pa
</code></pre>
<p>If instead, you use alsa replace &quot;pa&quot; with &quot;alsa&quot; in the above command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now time to load the live CD: (It's also worth mentioning if you ever fuck up your install of TempleOS, just re-run this to get the base version).</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">qemu-system-x86_64 -soundhw pcspk -m 512M -enable-kvm -drive file=temple -cdrom TempleOS.ISO -boot order=d
</code></pre>
<p>Feel free to change around certain settings, for example the ram.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installing onto the Virtual Disk.
upon starting up TempleOS, follow the prompts and install to the CD, after doing so, boot into the CD run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">qemu-system-x86_64 -soundhw pcspk -m 512M -enable-kvm -drive file=temple
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="qemu-side-note"><a class="header" href="#qemu-side-note">QEMU Side Note:</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The sound is incredibly loud sometimes; turn down your output for the love of God. I found this out the hard way; screaming &quot;Fuck my ears&quot;, as I had an error and subsequently the screeching of the error sound at 100%, my ears are still recovering to this day.</li>
<li>Also in case you can't exit TempleOS, just press CONTROL + A + G to bring your mouse back (this won't work in fullscreen; so probably don't use fullscreen). I mean I was honestly stuck twice, I couldn't kill the program using my Linux shortcut, nor could I switch windows on my WM; ended up having to just turn my PC's power off. 😅</li>
<li>I'd like to thank <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TempleOS_Official/comments/ewtp0n/templeos_with_sound_in_qemulinux_host/">this reddit post</a> for the info on QEMU.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="upon-installing"><a class="header" href="#upon-installing">Upon Installing</a></h1>
<p>After installing, and booting into TempleOS you'll be greeted with TempleOS's holiest and simplistic bootloader (Far greater than GNU GRUB; instead a glorious white man's bootloader), from here just enter <code>1</code> to boot into the C drive.</p>
<details>

<h1 id="the-os"><a class="header" href="#the-os">The OS</a></h1>
<p>Once fully inside, you'll be asked if you'd like to take the tour; thankfully Terry Davis was kind enough to teach people how to use his system, unlike a particular atheist. For the purpose of this guide, I'll be ignoring the guide and exploring things my own way - although, don't take that as an excuse to not explore the vastness of the tour, going so much as guiding you through everything, how kind of you Terry. Floating over on the right of your screen is a super helpful tool called &quot;AutoComplete&quot;; which - you guessed it - is a program that autocompletes what you're typing system-wide. Autocomplete can be enabled with <kbd>Alt+A</kbd> and disabled with <kbd>Shift+Alt+A</kbd>. From the start, we'll be greeted with two command windows or &quot;terminals&quot;.</p>
<p>The entirety of TempleOS - disregarding a portion of assembly code - is written in a C variant created by Terry A. Davis titled &quot;HolyC&quot; with its own appropriately named &quot;HolyC&quot; compiler. What might be surprising about TempleOS is that the &quot;SHELL&quot; environment goes directly to the compiler, thus being completely different from something like Linux using BASH which is a standalone program used for executing programs, instead TempleOS resembles something like how the Python Interpreter has its own Read-eval-print loop which feeds directly to the interpreter (although with HolyC it is way faster). Pairing one of the powerful languages with a direct user input might seem crazy, but it's ridiculously overpowered! <i>We will be diving deeper into commands and the inner workings in the next chapter.</i></p>
<details>
<summary><b>The Terminal</b></summary>
<br>
<img src="https://gitlab.com/eccentrici/templeos/-/raw/main/assets/tos_terminal.png"/>
</details>
<h1 id="the-ui"><a class="header" href="#the-ui">The UI</a></h1>
<p>At the top of the screen, a lot of system information is display; accurate date and time, FPS, Memory and CPU, and farthest to the right we have text displaying our last key press. Below this initial region we have a second bar of information for the current program; a link to the Personal Menu, task name, process ID, and our close button (depicted as <code>[X]</code>).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="keybindings"><a class="header" href="#keybindings">Keybindings</a></h1>
<p>Before continuing we should acknowledge some pre-defined keybindings which will become helpful in the following pages and chapters. It's about time we put such a creation to good use. It's alright if you don't understand the functionality of each keybinding, as their uses will be explored throughout this site. For good practice; keybindings are seperated into sections based on where they appear throughout this site. E.g, the &quot;Essential&quot; keybindings are highly important and are first introduced in the &quot;Diving In&quot; (<i>or this</i>) chapter.</p>
<h3 id="essentials-diving-in"><a class="header" href="#essentials-diving-in">Essentials (Diving In):</a></h3>
<p><kbd>Space</kbd>: acts as a keyboard alternative for the Left Mouse Button (LMB).<br />
<kbd>Enter</kbd>: similar to the aforementioned, this acts as an alternative to the Right Mouse Button (RMB).<br />
<kbd>F1</kbd>: press to bring up Help Menu.<br />
<kbd>CTRL+M</kbd>: press to go to your Personal Menu.<br />
<kbd>Escape</kbd>: press to save and exit.<br />
<kbd>Shift+Escape</kbd>: press to abort and exit.<br />
<kbd>Windows Key</kbd>: hold to show the drop-down menu; navigate using arrow keys.
<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+T</kbd>: opens a new terminal.<br />
<kbd>Ctrl+ALt+N</kbd>: switches window.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="programs"><a class="header" href="#programs">Programs</a></h1>
<p>Now that we've understood the UI, let's explore some programs on TempleOS. From the start, we have two terminal sessions open and AutoComplete running on the screen. Let's close all three of these, start off by hiding AutoComplete with <kbd>Shift+Alt+A</kbd>, next close the two open terminals by pressing the close button in the right corner or by pressing our abort keybinding (<kbd>Shift+Esc</kbd>). Upon closing the running programs, we are exposed to our wallpaper. On the bottom is an immovable task list, above it is a program called &quot;Adam&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="adam"><a class="header" href="#adam">Adam</a></h3>
<p>&quot;This is the adam task, he's- it's like Adam and Eve; he's the first task created at startup.&quot; - <a href="https://youtu.be/jCkZmIoZS1c?t=187">Terry A. Davis</a>. At startup, the Adam task is created and appears in the little window at the top beneath the user terminal windows. Because the Adam task is immutable, any memory objects that you don't want destroyed by the death of any one job are stored on Adam's heap. Adam executes the file <code>::/StartOS.HC</code> (<code>:</code> refers to the boot drive), when the Adam task is created. </p>
<h3 id="personal-menu"><a class="header" href="#personal-menu">Personal Menu</a></h3>
<p>Press <kbd>Ctrl+M</kbd> within a terminal to get to your Personal Menu, if you aren't in a terminal, press <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+T</kbd>. Your Personal Menu is exactly that; a customizable menu that houses links to programs, games, and files. You can click on items within your Personal Menu using your mouse. The Personal Menu is a standard DolDoc document; DolDoc is one of the most intriguing and underappreciated features of TempleOS, allowing you to embed 3D models and photos in documents and show them on the terminal. The Personal Menu is stored in <code>C:/Home/PersonalMenu.DD.Z</code>, we will be exploring how to edit files in a future chapter (it's also worth mentioning that <code>.Z</code> means that a file is compressed), for now, just know that the Personal Menu is your portal to all cool things in TempleOS; have fun and explore everything in it.</p>
<h4 id="fun-games"><a class="header" href="#fun-games">Fun Games</a></h4>
<p>Games in TempleOS are categorized as being &quot;Fun&quot; and &quot;Unfun&quot;.</p>
<details>
<summary><b>Titanium</b></summary>
<br>
In Titanium, you play as a Jet/Plane from a top-down perspective over land. Collect points as you shoot at enemies. You move with your arrow keys and shoot with <kbd>Space</kbd>. Titanium is one of my favorite games in TempleOS; it reminds me of Galaga except it's on Earth and the enemies don't fire back.
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary><b>Black Diamond</b></summary>
<br>
In Black Diamond, you play as a person skiing down a mountain, with the objective to not hit into trees, rocks, and what I presume are mountain lions, you are penalized for hitting into these objects. Your goal is to obtain a small enough penalty.
<br>
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary><b>Flap Bat</b></summary>
<br>
In Flap Bat, you play as a bat whose goal is to eat bugs. The bugs are a fixed amount that cycle through, your goal is to eat all of them in the lowest time possible. Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to flap and hold to glide; spamming does nothing but make you fall, the best way is to flap at a consistent speed.
