# Programs
Now that we've understood the UI, let's explore some programs on TempleOS. From the start, we have two terminal sessions open and AutoComplete running on the screen. Let's close all three of these, start off by hiding AutoComplete with <kbd>Shift+Alt+A</kbd>, next close the two open terminals by pressing the close button in the right corner or by pressing our abort keybinding (<kbd>Shift+Esc</kbd>). Upon closing the running programs, we are exposed to our wallpaper. On the bottom is an immovable task list, above it is a program called "Adam".

### Adam
"This is the adam task, he's- it's like Adam and Eve; he's the first task created at startup." - [Terry A. Davis](https://youtu.be/jCkZmIoZS1c?t=187). At startup, the Adam task is created and appears in the little window at the top beneath the user terminal windows. Because the Adam task is immutable, any memory objects that you don't want destroyed by the death of any one job are stored on Adam's heap. Adam executes the file `::/StartOS.HC` (`:` refers to the boot drive), when the Adam task is created. 

### Personal Menu
Press <kbd>Ctrl+M</kbd> within a terminal to get to your Personal Menu, if you aren't in a terminal, press <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+T</kbd>. Your Personal Menu is exactly that; a customizable menu that houses links to programs, games, and files. You can click on items within your Personal Menu using your mouse. The Personal Menu is a standard [DolDoc](./doldoc.md) document; The DolDoc filetype is one of the most intriguing and underappreciated features of TempleOS, allowing you to embed 3D models and photos in documents and show them on the terminal. The Personal Menu is stored in `C:/Home/PersonalMenu.DD.Z`, we will be exploring how to edit files in a future chapter (it's also worth mentioning that `.Z` means that a file is compressed), for now, just know that the Personal Menu is your portal to all cool things in TempleOS; have fun and explore everything in it.
