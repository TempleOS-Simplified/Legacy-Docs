# Keybindings
Before continuing we should acknowledge some pre-defined keybindings which will become helpful in the following pages and chapters. It's about time we put such a creation to good use. It's alright if you don't understand the functionality of each keybinding, as their uses will be explored throughout this site. For good practice; keybindings are seperated into sections based on where they appear throughout this site. E.g, the "Essential" keybindings are highly important and are first introduced in the "Exploring Deeper" (<i>or this</i>) chapter.

### Essentials (Exploring Deeper):
<kbd>Space</kbd>: acts as a keyboard alternative for the Left Mouse Button (LMB).  
<kbd>Enter</kbd>: similar to the aforementioned, this acts as an alternative to the Right Mouse Button (RMB).  
<kbd>F1</kbd>: press to bring up Help Menu.  
<kbd>CTRL+M</kbd>: press to go to your Personal Menu.   
<kbd>Escape</kbd>: press to save and exit.   
<kbd>Shift+Escape</kbd>: press to abort and exit.   
<kbd>Windows Key</kbd>: hold to show the drop-down menu; navigate using arrow keys.
<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+T</kbd>: opens a new terminal.   
<kbd>Ctrl+ALt+N</kbd>: switches window.
